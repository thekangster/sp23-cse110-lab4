1. ```values added: 20```
2. ```final result: 20```
3. ```values added: 20```
4. Line 13 returns an error because the let declaration of the variable result
   limits the variable's scope to the if statement's block. Thus, javascript
   can't log the value of ```result``` to the console because it doesn't have
   access to it outside of the if block.
5. The code results in an error because we try to reassign the value of the
   const-declared variable result. We do not get to the print statement.
6. Same as 5.
